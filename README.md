Build folder for API this is "SQLiteAPI/api/bin/build/Release"

Build folder for web app this is "build/web" (if it's not there you'll need to build it locally via 'flutter build web' from root folder in cmd)

to launch API you need to launch api.exe from its build folder

to lauch web app for testing purposes you need to open server with 55001 port (python http server works just fine)
